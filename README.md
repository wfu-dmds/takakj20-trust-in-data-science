# Trust in Data Science

## Week 3 

* We are proposing doing a two-phase study, in the first phase participants will see a paragraph about some quantitiative analysis with components about the data, the analysis, and the analyst. We will ask them overall whether they find the analysis believable and then will ask them to highlight portions of the text and rank the selection as making the overall information more or less believable
  
List below ideas for a paragraph to show participants in Phase 1 of our study

Overall ideas: neutral, relevant topics in health 
Elements: data, anaylysis, the analyst

## Week 1 & 2 Summary

I reviewed the 28 articles that Dr. McGowan selected and evaluated each abstract to decide if the focus was on data visualization, data analysis, both, or another topic. From there, I decided if they seemed related to our possible research, which lead to me reading about 11 articles. There were a few similar to our goal, either centered around machine learning, with a high level of base knowledge needed, or AI and trusting its output. There were also many articles that focused on what factors will help increase trust and what discrease trust, although between studies, the results were contradictory. In dicussion with Dr. McGowan, we talked through conducted a two phase study, where in the first phase, participatns will a paragraph on some anaylisis of data with information about the analysis and even the analyst. Then we will ask them to select portions of the paragraph and select if the information highlighted made the information believeable.
